        <p>
            Project Hamster is time tracking for individuals. It helps you to keep track on
            how much time you have spent during the day on activities you choose to track. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you change from doing one task to other, you change your current
            activity in Hamster. After a while you can see how many hours you have spent on
            what. Maybe print it out, or export to some suitable format, if time reporting
            is a request of your employee.
